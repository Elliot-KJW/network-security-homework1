# Task 1: Implementing Echo Client-Server

In our class, we have learned that a basic TCP client-server model can be easily implemented with Python. This is the good starting point for learning how to implement a socket program. The `task1` directory has `echo_server.py` and `echo_client.py` where some code snippets are already written. Fill the rest of the code where the `TODO:` is commented in order to make them working properly.

If you write code properly, the programs will be working as follows:

1. Run `python3 echo_server.py` in one terminal.
3. Run `python3 echo_client.py` in another terminal.
4. Type any string you want to send to server from the client-side.
5. Check that the string is printed out from the server-side correctly.
