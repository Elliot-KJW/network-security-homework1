# Task 1: Implementing Echo Client-Server

In our class, we have learned that a basic TCP client-server model can be easily implemented with Python. This is the good starting point for learning how to implement socket programs. The `task1` directory has `echo_server.py` and `echo_client.py` where some code snippets are already written. Fill the rest of the code where the `TODO:` is commented in order to make them working properly.

If you write a code properly, the programs will be working as follows:

1. Run `echo_server.py`
2. Run `echo_client.py`
3. Type any string you want to send to server from a client side.
4. Check that the string is printed out from the server side.
